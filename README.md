# STA130-Project
## Project Overview
Within this project, we aim to complete a thorough analysis of the transformer, xgboost, and ffnn models responsible for the prediction of conflict escalation in countries. We use data provided by UNlCEF as well as the Fund for Peace'sFragile States Index. By taking different subsets of this datadepending on different demographics and characteristics ofcountries, we aim to train our own regression model which would allow us to conclude how these demographics affect the performance of the three models identified above.

## Analysis Conclusions
From this analysis we can conclude which predictor variables lead to greater error being made by the model in its predictions.
##### ffnn:
A Greater Child Dependency Ratio
Lower Female Education
Greater Displacement of Individuals Under-18
##### xqboost:
Greater Total Population Under-18
##### transformer:
Greater GDP Per-Capita
Greater Total Population Under-18
